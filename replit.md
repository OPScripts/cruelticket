# Overview

This is a Discord bot built with discord.js v14 that manages a comprehensive ticket system with helper points and leaderboard functionality. The bot is designed for an AQW (AdventureQuest Worlds) guild to handle support requests across five categories: Ultra Weeklies, Ultra Speaker, Temple Shrine, Ultra Dailies, and Spamming. The system tracks helper contributions through a points system with an interactive leaderboard.

**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** Fully functional and production-ready

# System Architecture

## Application Structure

**File-based Data Persistence**: The application uses a JSON file (`data.json`) for data storage rather than a traditional database. This approach provides:
- Simple setup with no external database dependencies
- Easy data inspection and manual editing if needed
- Sufficient performance for small to medium-sized Discord servers
- Trade-off: Not suitable for high-concurrency scenarios or large-scale deployments

The data structure tracks nine main entities:
- `helperPoints`: Object mapping user IDs to their accumulated points
- `activeTickets`: Object storing currently open ticket information (includes selectedHelpers and completedBy during confirmation)
- `ticketCounter`: Incrementing integer for generating unique ticket IDs
- `categoryPoints`: Object mapping category names to point values (default: 1 per category)
- `ticketChannels`: Object mapping category names to channel/category IDs for ticket routing
- `logsChannel`: Channel ID where ticket logs are posted
- `allowedCompletionRoles`: Array of role IDs that can complete/finalize tickets
- `allowedCreationRoles`: Array of role IDs that can create and use tickets

## Bot Architecture

**Discord.js Gateway Bot**: Uses the standard Discord Gateway API with intents (`GatewayIntentBits.Guilds` and `GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages`), which:
- Reduces memory footprint and API rate limit consumption
- Focuses on slash commands and guild-level interactions
- Enables transcript generation by fetching message history
- Note: MessageContent intent can be enabled in Discord Developer Portal for full message content in transcripts

**Slash Command Interface**: The bot implements Discord's slash command system with:
- `/setup-panel`: Admin-only command to initialize the ticket interface in any channel
- `/leaderboard`: Public command to display top 10 helper rankings
- `/reset-leaderboard`: Admin-only command to reset all helper points
- `/points <category> <points>`: Admin-only command to set custom point values for each category
- `/setup-ticket <category> <channel>`: Admin-only command to route tickets to specific channels/categories
- `/setup-logs <channel>`: Admin-only command to designate a logging channel for ticket events
- `/setup-roles <role>`: Admin-only command to add roles that can complete/finalize tickets
- `/setup-roles2 <role>`: Admin-only command to add roles that can create and use tickets

## Ticket System Design

**Category-based Tickets**: The system organizes tickets into predefined categories, each with specific required fields:
- All categories collect: Room Name, Server Name, AQW Username
- This structured approach ensures consistent data collection across all ticket types
- Modal-based input collection for structured data entry

**Component-based UI**: The architecture uses Discord's interactive components:
- Buttons for ticket creation, completion, and cancellation actions
- String select menus for category selection
- User select menus for multi-helper selection (allows 1-25 selections)
- Modals for detailed information input
- Action rows to organize interactive elements

## Data Flow

**Synchronous File Operations**: The implementation uses synchronous file I/O (`readFileSync`/`writeFileSync`):
- Simpler error handling and code flow
- Acceptable for low-frequency operations (ticket creation/closure)
- Trade-off: May cause brief blocking on I/O operations, but negligible impact for Discord bot use cases

**In-memory Data Loading**: Data is loaded from file and likely cached in memory during bot runtime, with saves triggered on state changes (ticket creation, closure, point awards).

# External Dependencies

## Discord.js Library (v14.22.1)

Primary framework providing:
- Gateway connection management and WebSocket handling
- Slash command builders and registration
- Interactive component handling (buttons, modals, select menus)
- Event system for Discord events
- Permission and intent management

## Node.js Built-in Modules

- **fs (File System)**: Handles reading/writing the JSON data file
- **path**: Manages file path construction in a cross-platform manner

## Discord API

The bot integrates with Discord's REST and Gateway APIs:
- **Gateway API**: Real-time event subscription and bot presence
- **Slash Commands API**: Command registration and handling
- **Interactions API**: Button clicks, modal submissions, select menu selections
- **Permissions System**: Role-based access control for administrative commands

## Runtime Environment

Expected deployment on Replit or similar Node.js hosting platform with:
- Persistent file storage for `data.json`
- Environment variable support for Discord bot token (`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`)
- Always-on or keep-alive mechanism to maintain bot connection

# Recent Changes

**October 5, 2025 - Ticket Completion Restrictions and Transcript Updates:**

  - Removed automatic DM delivery of transcripts to users
  - Centralizes all ticket records in the log channel for better management

**October 1, 2025 - Ticket Visibility, Mentions, and Transcripts Update:**
- **Enhanced Ticket Visibility:**
  - All roles configured via `/setup-roles2` (creation roles) now automatically receive view and message permissions in ticket channels
  - Ensures helpers and support staff can see and respond to all tickets regardless of who created them
  - Role existence checks prevent errors when roles are deleted from the server
- **Fixed Mention System:**
  - Removed automatic mentions of all creation roles when tickets are created
  - Only mentions @Helpers role if it exists AND is configured in `/setup-roles2`

- **Transcript Feature:**
  - Automatic transcript generation when tickets are completed or canceled
  - Transcripts saved as .txt files containing full conversation history with timestamps
  - Includes message content, embeds, and attachment URLs
  - Transcripts sent only to configured logs channel for record-keeping
  - Fetches all messages in batches (up to 100 at a time) to ensure complete history
  - Note: Enable MessageContent intent in Discord Developer Portal for full message content visibility

**October 1, 2025 - Latest Update:**
- **Dynamic Role Management:**
  - Added `/setup-roles` command to configure which roles can complete/finalize tickets

  - Roles are stored dynamically in data.json and can be updated anytime by administrators
  - Replaced hardcoded role IDs with flexible, configurable role system
- **Ticket Creation Permissions:**
  - Users without roles set via `/setup-roles2` cannot create tickets

- **Permission System:**
  - Complete ticket requires user to be the ticket creator (only ticket creator can mark as complete)
